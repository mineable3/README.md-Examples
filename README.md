# Titles
  A title with a little header link can be made with a hashtag this: "# title"
  The more hashtags the smaller the size of the tile like so:
  ## two hashtags
  ### three hashtags
  #### four hashtags
  ##### five hashtags
  
  notice how they get smaller, but still are headers and clicking the link symbol to the left automatically shows that section
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  See the line above ^^^ well that can be done by typing "--------", but longer
  
  ##Effecting text
  This is done using different numbers of "*" on each side of your phrase like so:"\*hello world\*"
  
  *one asterisk* gives us italics
  
  **two asterisks** gives us bold
  
  ***three asterisks*** gives us both bold and italics
  
  ## Links
  links follow a fairly straight forward syntax: "\[text to hold link](website_to_go_to.com)"
  
  For example, check out my google doc with notes on how to use git itself: [my git notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q2R9QO78o-iJLi1GW6dCZWSvsjNILX4Ry8gwnm_qAJs/edit?usp=sharing)
  
  or you can make a link to your titles/headers like the [next section](#bullet-points)
  
  ## Bullet Points
  
  instead of having actual bullets you'll have to type out "- item"
  
  - item 1
 
    - sub item 1.1
    
    - sub item 1.2
    
    
  - item 2
  
## Code Snippets
just wrap the code you want in " ` " like I've been doing with quotation marks

`System.out.println("Hello World!");`
